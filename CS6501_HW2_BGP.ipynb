The data we will use in this assignment was collected from 18:22 to 21:11 on Feb 24, 2008, UTC. You can find the original data source [here](http://archive.routeviews.org/bgpdata/2008.02/) and the complete data archive on [RouteViews](http://archive.routeviews.org/).\n",

        "There are two types of data: RIB (rib.\\*) and UPDATE (updates.\\*). RIB stands for *Routing Information Base*, which shows the full routing table. For example, *rib.20080224.1822* is a snapshot of the full routing table at 18:22 UTC on 02/24/2008. RIB files are usually large.\n",
        "\n",
        "UPDATE files only show BGP update messages received during a time interval. The collector saves BGP updates to file every 15 minutes. For example, *updates.20080224.1839* contains all BGP announcements received from 18:39 to 18:54. UPDATE files are much smaller than RIB files.\n",

If you want to explore additional data (e.g., for your final project), you will need to parse them out.
